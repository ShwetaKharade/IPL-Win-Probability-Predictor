üèè IPL Win Probability Predictor
This repository contains a machine learning project designed to predict the win probability of teams during IPL matches.By leveraging Logistic Regression, the model provides real-time winning probabilities.
üß† Methodology
Data Collection: Collected IPL match data, including runs, wickets, overs, and match outcomes.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
Modeling:Trained a Logistic Regression model to classify win probabilities.Features include team scores, overs, wickets, and match conditions.
Evaluation: Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
Deployment: Built a simple web application for real-time predictions.
